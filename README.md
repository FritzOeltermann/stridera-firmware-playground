# stridera-firmware-playground
This repo serves as a playground for working with an ESP32-S3-WROOM microcontroller and some sensors from the LAFVIN Super Starter Kit. We want to explore working with the Arduino Framework and PlatformIO and possibly develop some Firmware modules, that can be reused in the proper Stridera Firmware Repositroy.
